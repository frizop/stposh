Add PowerShell support to Sublime Text 2

UPDATE 28.02.2013: Added the posibility of using highlighing in line comments (if the theme supports it),
by using '!!!' as highlighting keyword. Example: "# This is !!!highlighted"

Includes 11 themes (some are still WIP) and one dark theme template.

Supports syntax highlighting of native PowerShell 3 cmdlets and language, as well as added cmdlets for:

- Microsoft Failover Cluster
- Microsoft Network Load Balancing Cluster (NLB)
- poshGit
- VMWare PowerCLI
- Active Directory
- Group Policy

Also included are full command completions of native PowerShell 3 cmdlets as well as the following snippets:

- Begin Block
- Process Block
- End Block
- Comment Block
- Comment Based Help
- CmdletBinding
- Function - simple
- Function - advanced
- Parameter
- Regex validate: URL
- foreach
- for
- if
- if-else
- elseif
- else
- do-until
- do-while
- switch
- try-catch
- try-catch-finally
- while

User-defined functions will populate symbol list.

NOTE! This work is partly based on the existing PowerShell 2 addon for Sublime Text 2 by Guillermo LÃ³pez-Anglada (https://github.com/SublimeText/PowerShell)
